# Boilermake-Extension-FrontEnd
This is the front end development to my Boilermake Hackathon group's project, which involves a google chrome extension that is able to
check the article that the user is currently viewing for fake news. It also includes a separate website which can show information about
the user's news browsing habits based off of the data we collect, along with rankings of sites based off of data from all users.
